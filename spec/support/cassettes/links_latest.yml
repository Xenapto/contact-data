        2006]Developed by Techland [full credits] \u00a0[video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-iPjMTVBjA
        560x340]\u00a0The Western is one of film\u2019s most iconic and beloved genres,
        but has long been overlooked in video games.\u00a0 Other than a handful of
        Western-themed shooters from the 90s, such as Gunsmoke, Sunset Riders, and
        Wild Guns, we haven\u2019t played cowboys and Indians in a virtual playground.\u00a0
        Then in the mid-00s the genre saw a brief revival spurred by Rockstar\u2019s
        Red Dead Revolver, followed by Neversoft\u2019s excellent Gun, and punctuated
        with Techland\u2019s Call of Juarez.\u00a0 With nothing more than a history
        of budget PC titles behind the developer, you\u2019d expect Techland\u2019s
        effort wouldn\u2019t be worth note.\u00a0 Nevertheless,\u00a0 upon finishing
        Call of Juarez I concluded that I didn\u2019t just play the most faithful
        ode to the Western, but one of the all time great first person shooters.  While
        Red Dead Revolver and Gun were good games with their own takes on the genre,
        I found that both faltered in one major area; it always seemed like the most
        memorable moments representative of the Western were delivered through cutscenes,
        in those games.\u00a0 Of course such an obvious ode to a genre remembered
        through film rather than books will appear cinematic in delivery, but I often
        wanted to shut those games off and just watch The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
        again.\u00a0 Techland completely understand this and sought to make a decisively
        immersive experience.\u00a0 It\u2019s safe to say that the game build itself
        on the same model of Half-Life, where the attention is always on you, the
        player, with no breaks from the action.\u00a0 None of this would matter though
        if the story didn\u2019t hold up.  Call of Juarez\u2019s story is epic in
        scope, complex in theory, but simple and enjoyable in execution.\u00a0 In
        the game, you play as both Billy Candle, a young misunderstood rebel who returns
        to his home only to be wrongly accused of murder, and Reverend Ray, Billy\u2019s
        bat shit crazy step-father who chases him in response to the murder.\u00a0
        You alternate between these two characters throughout the game.\u00a0 Techland
        really took a step back from the Western and thought of ways to implement
        the genre into the interactive medium rather than just sandwich a story better
        suited for the cinema around chunks of gameplay.\u00a0 Playing opposing characters
        who are at each other\u2019s neck really makes for some memorable moments
        and an exciting story that owes as much to The Fugitive as it does to Western
        classics.\u00a0 Saying where the game story goes after the opening 3 hours
        would lead to some major spoilers, but know that this is secretly the best
        Indian Jones game since The Fate of Atlantis.  It\u2019s rare that we see
        story and gameplay come together as well as it does in Call of Juarez.\u00a0
        The gameplay elements by themselves aren\u2019t anything groundbreaking, but
        when you are sneaking through a bandit camp with the right context given it
        can be a lot of fun.\u00a0 And, make no mistake; you will be doing a lot of
        sneaking when you play as Billy Candle, the young gun.\u00a0 This leads me
        to the biggest complaint of the game, the opening chapter.\u00a0 The game
        opens with a handful of infuriating stealth sections that are noticeably worse
        than the rest of the game.\u00a0 When you couple this with the steep learning
        curve, it can be enough to throw the controller down and never pick it up
        again.\u00a0 If you stick with it, you\u2019ll soon be playing as Reverend
        Ray and it\u2019s a good time from that point on.\u00a0 There are some familiar
        mechanics at play, such as a quickdraw mode similar to the one in Gun, bow-and-arrow
        fights, and horseback riding.\u00a0 The stand-out moments of the game, however,
        lie in its variety.\u00a0 One chapter will have you climbing a mountain that
        recalls Shadow of the Colossus, another will have you solving the mystery
        of a hidden treasure that feels like an old-school adventure title, and then
        you\u2019ll have plenty of straight-forward action chapters, like one where
        you have to fight off a gang from within a mine shaft\u2014and yes you\u2019ll
        be able to ride in a mine cart and derail enemies just like in Temple of Doom.    Call
        of Juarez is rough around the edges; between the lacking intro and awkward
        quick draw controls, there is room for improvement, which the upcoming sequel
        will hopefully address.\u00a0 There is no doubt that the pros strongly outweigh
        the cons.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if it is a short adventure, it is much better than
        most modern westerns that make it to theatres.\u00a0 If you are an Indiana
        Jones fan or western fan or first person shooter fan or\u2026hell, this is
        just a game that needs to be played and appreciated by anyone who is a fan
        of inventive games with a strong narrative.\u00a0 Whether it was bad timing
        in its release or just ahead of its time in its design, Call of Juarez has
        been an unsung hero in the FPS genre for far too long.\u00a0 It may lay low
        on Metacritic with a yellow rating, but the term \u201cburied treasure\u201d
        has never been more appropriate.","title":"Call of Juarez\u00a0Review","updated_at":"2014-07-29T08:57:54Z","url":"http://venturebeat.com/2009/06/17/call-of-juarez-review/"},{"contact_type":"organization","created_at":"2014-07-29T08:57:40Z","domain":"venturebeat.com","id":3939131,"news_source":"VentureBeat","publication_date":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","slug":"paramark","summary":"    When
        I sat down a few weeks ago to plan which upcoming games I would be purchasing
        I decided that I really wanted to play both inFAMOUS and Prototype. Despite
        the similarities in genre and gameplay style each had a unique quirk that
        prevented me from disregarding it in favour of the other. The comic book art
        style and general superhero shtick of inFAMOUS appealed to the comic book
        fan in me, and the idea of a re-imagined Hulk: Ultimate Destruction with all
        the \u2018next-gen\u2019 trappings of a modern action game also piqued my
        interest.\u00a0  Despite my intentions to buy and play both games I have only
        purchased and played inFAMOUS. Not because I don\u2019t have the money or
        because I\u2019m having trouble finding a copy, but because playing inFAMOUS
        has killed any desire I previously had to play Prototype, in fact I\u2019ve
        gone from being extremely excited for Prototype to actively avoiding it.  This
        kind of emotion is unusual to me; it is a completely irrational response,
        an illogical dismissal of something despite having no contact or experience
        with it, it is the kind of characteristic pioneered and perfected by fanboys
        and I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m not a crazed fanboy (does a fanboy
        know whether he or she is a fanboy?). I\u2019ve been struggling to figure
        out what has caused this and after thinking long and hard I\u2019ve come to
        a conclusion, fate, yes \u2013 fate!\u00a0  My opinions of inFAMOUS are about
        as irrational as my opinions of Prototype, although I can recognise that the
        game has numerous flaws; the hawkeyed sharpshooting enemies, the repetitive
        mission types and numerous glitches to name a few, I have fallen completely
        and utterly in love with inFAMOUS. I\u2019m infatuated the point that I\u2019m
        am actively enjoying aspects of the game that I would cite as clich\u00e9
        and contrived if it were featured in any other game. Cole\u2019s bald headed
        gruff voiced character design is extremely generic, but I\u2019ll still argue
        he is much cooler than Alex Mercer despite feeling deep down that I wouldn\u2019t
        be surprised if it turned out they were identical twins split at birth as
        part of a social experiment. Other than Cole\u2019s ability to command electricity
        in various forms his only other skill is his familiarity with the city and
        his skills in \u2018Urban exploration\u2019. To me it\u2019s a beautiful method
        of effortlessly moving from point to point with the finesse of a calm breeze,
        but to everyone else it\u2019s that Parkour crap that everyone seems to be
        able to do ever since Altair showed up, jumped from a shack to a windowsill
        and then walked along a beam and into some hay. Sure, I know it\u2019s Parkour
        but I\u2019ll still maintain that the gameplay and feel of Cole\u2019s particular
        brand of Parkour is much better than Altair\u2019s or Alex\u2019s, \u2014
        like I said, completely irrational.\u00a0  It seems Sucker Punch has created
        a game that clicks with me on every level, every aspect of the game ranging
        from the comic book visuals to the electricity infused combat, the simple
        but cool characters to the typical and slightly predictable anime/comic book
        style storyline appeals to me. It appeals to me on a level that even lets
        me appreciate and enjoy the aspects of the game that are so clearly generic
        and uninspired. It\u2019s almost as if Sucker Punch had a detailed psych profile
        of me and then created a game perfectly suited for me, a game that I was predetermine
        to love.  \u00a0After playing inFAMOUS and looking at Prototype all I can
        see is a game that seems to have been rushed, an uninspired and poorly updated
        rehash of an old title, created with the kitchen sink approach to development
        and wrapped in bland, unremarkable and unappealing visuals, and I say all
        this having never played the game.   Yeah I know, I know what I am\u2026So,
        Bitmob community, I ask you: have you ever been enamored with a game like
        this before, has there been a game that has reduced you from a sane\u00a0

        640x505]While we have virtual console, XBLA, and PSN to re-spark peoples\u2019
        interest in old console games, many 90s PC titles are forever lost.\u00a0
        In many cases, it\u2019s better that the budget titles, FMV disasters, and
        quick cash-ins are forgotten.\u00a0 Then there are exceptions like Harvester.\u00a0
        Harvester came out at the wrong time, as many critics saw it as nothing more
        than a late FMV adventure release complimented by a disturbing story.\u00a0
        I guess that\u2019s not far from the truth, but the fact that there hasn\u2019t
        been a game released like it in 13 years is telling of the game\u2019s originality.\u00a0
        Like all adventure games, you play Harvester for the story and the little
        interaction between the long dialog scenes.\u00a0 Thankfully, these breaks
        don\u2019t feel like empty item searching but a chance to regain your sanity
        for a brief moment.  As the story begins, you play the role of Steve who awakes
        in the town of Harvester in 1952.\u00a0 Everyone acts as if they\u2019ve known
        him for years, but it doesn\u2019t take long until he starts to notice the
        creepy, Stepford-esque nature of the town. \u00a0Harvester, with a meager
        population of 51, revolves around an exclusive club called the Lodge which
        is located in a giant, esoteric temple in the center of town.\u00a0 As the
        player, you are given little hints as to who you are but the real truth lies
        in the Lodge, so Steve must gain entry into the building at all cost.\u00a0
        For the first 2/3rds of the game, you\u2019ll be solving local mysteries in
        the day time and passing the Lodge entry trials at night (which are of a much
        more sinister nature).\u00a0   The story doesn\u2019t really pick up until
        the game\u2019s final half, but it\u2019s the characters and script that hold
        the player\u2019s interest throughout the entirety of the adventure.\u00a0
        The game will recall Silent Hill for many players, but that game\u2019s characters
        seem almost PG friendly when compared to the unsavory, perverted residents
        of Harvester.\u00a0 You can stop by the high school where the teachers say
        \u201cdiscipline\u201d but mean molesting and beating kids with a bat, or
        visit the police department where Deputy Loomis jerks-off every hour the sheriff
        is away.\u00a0 Every character has their own dirty secret, and the ones that
        seem the most harmless often are holding back the worst.\u00a0   Harvester
        is a classic point-and-click adventure and one of the easier ones at that.\u00a0
        Unlike other adventure games where you need to cycle through touching, seeing,
        and talking pointers, Harvester only gives you one which will changes depending
        on the context of the object you are pointing at.\u00a0 Harvester is of a
        much more logical nature then many other adventure games of its time.\u00a0
        Still, you\u2019ll run into a couple of badly designed portions.\u00a0 For
        example, I ran into a snag halfway through the game with no indication of
        where to go next.\u00a0 After turning to a FAQ, it turns out I needed to pick
        up a dolly in the background of a garage that is barely visible, use it on
        a shelf at my house, and disable an alarm system so I can break into a window
        of my own house.\u00a0 I could have spent an hour clicking on everything and
        not have come to that conclusion.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t unexpected for a 90s
        adventure game but it certainly holds the game back.  Harvester is at its
        best when it breaks from the genre\u2019s norms, which it often does.\u00a0
        The freedom Harvester gives you to explore is refreshing and will leave players
        with some moderately different experiences.\u00a0 There are optional characters
        you can meet, optional side-plots you can explore, alternate dialog choices,
        extra weapons you can find, and you can even get arrested and have an \u201cescape
        from jail\u201d sequence.\u00a0 If this sounds like a lot of ground for a
        1996 adventure title to cover, it is.\u00a0 There are some quirks, like when
        I talked to my mom after 4 days and she went on a long illogical rant, citing
        things that already happened as if they were upcoming events.\u00a0 Also,
        the combat is far from exceptional.\u00a0 You just click up, front, or down
        to melee your enemies to death or shoot them with a shotgun or nail gun.\u00a0
        It works well enough and it\u2019s a fun diversion, so I thought it was a
        good addition even if it wouldn\u2019t hold up on its own.\u00a0 It\u2019s
        especially fun to kill the townsfolk and see just how much you can get away
        with.  Many people are watching this video and thinking \u201cthis game looks
        like shit\u201d to which I say, play it!\u00a0 You need to play Harvester
        to get the deep rooted sense of dark comedy that turns Harvester from another
        dated FMV disaster like Phantasmagoria into a timeless PC classic.\u00a0 The
        game has a strong identity and plays to all its cheesiness in the same way
        The Evil Dead film series did. \u00a0In effect, this makes everything lacking
        in its design and all the glitches into rather amusing quirks that only make
        the experience more enjoyable.\u00a0 While Silent Hill shares a similar take
        on psychological horror, Harvester is much more comedic and all the better
        for it.  If you haven\u2019t been able to tell yet, Harvester is a very violent
        and disturbing title.\u00a0 You\u2019d think a 13 year old game would be tame
        by today\u2019s standards, but the imagery of Harvester is still unsettling,
        and thanks to the FMV incorporation, all too real.\u00a0 I can\u2019t think
        of another game that has you killing 3 kids with a scythe as their intestines
        cover the screen\u2014it\u2019s some real ugly stuff.\u00a0 If you play until
        the game\u2019s end, it will all make sense why the game is this way but that
        doesn\u2019t make any of these scenes tasteful.\u00a0 As long as you can stomach
        it all, playing until the game\u2019s finale is a must.\u00a0 The ending Lodge
        portion of the game is just some of the most twisted, poignant, disturbing,
        and violent stuff to ever make it into a video game.\u00a0 I remember lending
        this game to a friend in 5th grade and his parents banned me from their house
        for the rest of the year.\u00a0 When judging by the content that fills the
        game, I can\u2019t really accuse them of overreacting.  The biggest problem
        with Harvester in 2009 has less to do with the game and more to do with getting
        it to run.\u00a0 Like many old PC titles, you\u2019ll need to run it through
        Dosbox which is a task unto itself.\u00a0 On top of that, there is a myriad
        of problems you\u2019ll face like background music cutting off and occasional
        crashes.\u00a0 Nevertheless, once you know how to run the game you, you\u2019re
        in for one of the sickest and hilarious games to ever be released.\u00a0 I
        still have yet to play a game with a script as bold and original as Harvester,
        and it\u2019s a shame we never saw another game from its developers.\u00a0
        It might seem like a hassle to get the game to run, but this is a game that
        deserves to be reevaluated by the \u201cgames as art\u201d-obsessed media
        of the past decade.\u00a0And here is a video I made of the game that will
        scar you for life\u2026\u00a0[video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcmycWp6O-Q

        it takes is one try, like dropping a toaster into the bathtub. As soon as
        the crackle of electricity flows from Cole\u2019s fingers like sweet elocution,
        you know that with its combination of looks and gameplay that developer Sucker
        Punch has crafted a gem. Not that their ability to create a great game should
        ever have been doubted. After all, Sly Cooper was a great series, one unjustly
        overshadowed by Sony\u2019s other platforming titans: Ratchet and Clank and
        Jak and Daxter. Even with the developer\u2019s strong pedigree, they had never
        created anything outside of the Sly universe; coupled with the pitfalls that
        usually plague the open-world/sandbox genre it\u2019s understandable how one
        may have been weary of what Infamous could come to offer. \u00a0One of my
        biggest grievances of the open-world formula is that most of them, while being
        solid in gameplay, sacrifice a likable story, character development and in
        many cases an understandable plot free of convolution for the do-anything,
        go-anywhere play style. While Infamous certainly hasn\u2019t graduated from
        such problems, it does represent the furthering matriculation of the open-world
        genre. The first and most noticeable improvement is the fantastic comic book
        art which accompanies the storytelling cut-scenes. Where Dice\u2019s Mirror\u2019s
        Edge failed in its comic book styled cut scenes is exactly where Infamous
        triumphs. The artistry portrays a darkened world, decimated by disaster and
        conspiracy. The only light is Cole who, surviving a catastrophic explosion,
        has become the unwilling possessor of great supernatural ability. The plot
        immediately harkens one\u2019s memory to Stan Lee\u2019s now famous words,
        made popular by the legendary Spiderman series, \u201cWith great power comes
        great responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 Power and responsibility become the two
        over-arching themes as Cole, electricity coursing through his veins, has been
        single-handedly tasked with either saving or condemning his city. The plot,
        while sandbox game thin, offers just enough to keep the player interested
        in progressing through it, and I felt myself intrigued to further my understanding
        of the developing conspiracy and to encounter the next over-the-top villain.
        \u00a0\u00a0  The next pitfall Infamous needed to sidestep was the binary
        good or evil gameplay choice. While I am a fan of moral consequences in games,
        made famous by Bioware\u2019s Knights of the Old Republic series, I do subscribe
        to the desire of many gamers in wanting a middle ground, a gray neutrality
        between the extremes of light and dark. Also, when faced with questions of
        morality in a game, I tend to suffer from \u201cgoody-goody\u201d disease
        and find it difficult to play out the role of a villain. While Infamous doesn\u2019t
        allow you a neutral option,\u00a0 it does make being evil not only easy but
        preferable. \u00a0To understand how Sucker Punch manages to create this feeling,
        imagine Cole\u2019s persona as a love child between Spiderman and a 50\u2019s
        style film noir detective.\u00a0 In keeping with the half of him reminiscent
        of Sam Spade, Cole speaks with the deep rasp of a man who\u2019s smoked a
        carton of cigarettes a day since he was knee high to duck, and he approaches
        each moral obligation with the same warmth and attachment a rich republican
        feels when giving to charity for the tax write-off. Cole, whether you choose
        to save or destroy the city, remains relatively cold and detached from the
        situation evolving around him. It is this detachment that makes playing the
        villain easy and fun.  The gameplay is nearly flawless; Cole interacts with
        the environment wonderfully, able to cling and climb on nearly anything in
        the world. The RPG-like evolution of Cole\u2019s powers is fun to experiment
        with as his power options differ depending on what moral choices the player
        makes. The boss battles are interesting and creative and feature some of the
        best villains I\u2019ve witnessed outside of a comic. Infamous, while including
        basic fetch and collect missions, does manage to avoid the tedium of games
        like Assassin\u2019s Creed by providing many varied tasks in which the player
        can partake. Also, unlike Assassin\u2019s Creed or Mirror\u2019s Edge, I found
        that it does lack the frantic running and evading that I have come to hope
        for in parkour inspired games. Cole\u2019s animations for grabbing and leaping
        can become static and awkward, but in a game where you can grab onto almost
        anything, such a minor issue is easily forgettable.  In the last few years,
        our own non-virtual world has seen its fair share of disasters, from Tsunamis
        and Hurricanes to true evil. As our own world grows darker, it seems more
        and more difficult to embrace the traditional un-conflicted, \u201clight is
        right\u201d hero. In response, the world of Infamous is a nice artistic representation
        of the challenges facing our own world, and Cole does a great job of usurping
        the mantle of the iconic, dark, morality-torn anti-hero. Sucker Punch has
        crafted a wonderful new canon in the ever-crowding super hero genre. One that
        hopefully marks the beginning in the company\u2019s new direction, though
        I\u2019m still crossing my fingers for a new Sly Cooper addition. Also, don\u2019t
        drop toasters into bathtubs; it\u2019s bad news.  Final Score: 8.5/10","title":"With
