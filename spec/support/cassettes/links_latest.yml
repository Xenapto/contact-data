        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background

        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        federal government after an IT project he worked on was never introduced.
        (Photo: Damon Scheleur/Huffington Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nChris
        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s

        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a

        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom

        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        last. According to Blizzard \u201cthe official forums have always been a great
        place to discuss the latest info on our games, offer ideas and suggestions,
        and share experiences with other players \u2014 however, the forums have also
        earned a reputation as a place where flame wars, trolling, and other unpleasantness

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s

        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"

        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the

        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the

        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the

        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom

        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"

        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"

        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"feature-dropcap\">O</span>ne
        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and

        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen

        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and

        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and

        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"

        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br

        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA

        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d

        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started

        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They

        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will

        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"

        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.

        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br

        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,

        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers

        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate

        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and

        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup

        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br

        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"feature-dropcap\">O</span>ne
        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is

        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say

        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former

        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br

        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"

        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of

        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"

        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d

        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of

        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"

        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom

        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a

        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"

        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of

        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        federal government after an IT project he worked on was never introduced.

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by

        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results

        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br

        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They

        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health

        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive

        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br

        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"feature-dropcap\">O</span>ne
        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"feature-dropcap\">O</span>ne
        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span class=\"feature-dropcap\">O</span>ne
        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers

        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen

        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit

        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"

        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br

        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website

        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of
        the site with Amazon\u2019s cloud computing services.<br />\n<br />\nOthers
        are calling on more former tech experts from the campaign to help the president
        run his administration.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve done things
        that transformed elections, but we now need that work to carry into transforming
        government,\u201d Clay Johnson, a programmer for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign,
        and Harper Reed, former chief technology officer of Obama for America, <a

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F

        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br

        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say

        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"

        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody

        -- There may be no foosball tables or luxury buses ferrying employees to work,
        but a new startup in the nation\u2019s capital is offering other incentives
        to lure tech talent away from Silicon Valley.</p><br />\n<br />\nIt is sharing
        its work on GitHub, a popular website for open-source software, to appeal
        to coders. It is opening another office in San Francisco for those who don\u2019t
        want to live in Washington. And it is convincing civic-minded techies to build
        websites, apps and other digital tools that serve their country.<br />\n<br
        />\nIt\u2019s all part of an effort to persuade computer wizards to reject
        the lure of Google or Facebook and work for someone who isn\u2019t thought
        of as an innovator: Uncle Sam.<br />\n<br />\nThe startup, named 18F for its
        location on 18th and F Streets, is the in-house tech team for the federal
        government. It launched in March as part of a growing push in Washington to
        overcome a shortage of tech experts that was apparent last fall during the
        disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. <br />\n<br />\nWhile Silicon Valley
        may offer more money or the chance to build cooler products, 18F employees
        chose to work in government for other reasons.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThis is
        the place to get big things done,\u201d Hillary Hartley, 18F\u2019s co-founder,
        said on a recent morning at the startup\u2019s open-air office, where a few
        programmers quietly typed code on MacBooks and stared into monitors. <br />\n<br
        />\n\"If you build something [in government] and it\u2019s successful, it
        is going to touch an enormous amount of people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd
        that\u2019s intoxicating.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nBut with just 31 employees
        so far, 18F is a mere blip in a government bureaucracy with some 80,000 tech
        workers. And critics say the Obama administration has a long way to go before
        it can build a sustainable high-tech workforce.<br />\n<br />\nThe push to
        recruit more tech experts comes as many Americans expect access to almost
        everything -- including their government -- online. The recent glitches with
        the federal health care website proved the Obama administration needs to find
        more people with experience building high-traffic websites, said Paul Smith,
        37, a software engineer and programmer who helped fix HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere''s only going to be more expectation, more demand for transactional,
        consumer-facing services from the government, not less,\u201d Smith said.
        \u201cSo there''s only going to be more HealthCare.gov-like sites.\u201d<br
        />\n<br />\nThe Obama administration\u2019s talent shortage stands in contrast
        to the army of programmers and engineers who used cutting-edge digital tools
        to target voters and help the president win reelection in 2012. More than
        200 people worked on the campaign\u2019s digital operations. Many had left
        jobs at Facebook, Google and Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nBut after the election,
        almost all of them chose to return to tech companies or launch their own startups
        instead of taking jobs with the government. <br />\n<br />\nCarol Davidsen,
        who used digital tools to help the Obama campaign target swing voters with
        TV ads, said she chose not to pursue a government job after the election partly
        because she worried she would be misunderstood in D.C. Instead, she co-founded
        a startup called Cir.cl that creates a marketplace for like-minded buyers
        and sellers.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI still don''t think a lot of people in
        government and Washington have a lot of respect for technologists,\u201d Davidsen
        said in an email. \u201cIn general, I don''t want to be in a situation where
        I feel like I have to take direction from someone who doesn''t appreciate
        or understand the complexities of what it is that a great technologist or
        software engineer does.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch cultural differences between
        the tech and policy worlds help explain why the government struggles to recruit
        programmers and engineers. After the HealthCare.gov failures, \u201cdeep questions
        remain\u201d about whether the government can \u201cidentify, cultivate, and
        retain individuals with the necessary skills for success in a world increasingly
        driven by information technology,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/news/afutureoffailure.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a recent report</a> commissioned by the Ford
        Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nAbout 70 percent
        of people with math and science degrees take jobs in the private sector, while
        4 percent go to work for the federal government, the report found.<br />\n<br
        />\nTech talent is also not evenly distributed across government. The National
        Security Agency has attracted an abundance of computer experts with its tech-driven
        mission, while other government agencies, like those involved in social problems,
        \u201care relatively starved for such talent,\u201d the report said.<br />\n<br
        />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"feature-section\"><br />\n<br />\n<span
        class=\"feature-dropcap\">T</span>he launch of 18F is the latest government
        attempt to bridge the tech talent gap. In 2012, the White House created the
        President Innovation Fellows program to recruit employees in the tech industry
        to work on government IT projects for six to 12 months. The program\u2019s
        first round received 1,200 applications for 18 positions, according to Tom
        Kalil, the White House deputy director for technology and innovation.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThis is more competitive than the Ivies,\u201d Kalil said at a recent
        forum hosted by the New America Foundation. <br />\n<br />\nThe fellows have
        built digital tools that help consumers save money on electricity bills or
        get secure online access to health records. Current fellows are building a
        website that will be a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d for veterans to access VA
        services and benefits.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KK0HOIqOcHw\"
        target=\"_hplink\">A video about the program</a> on the White House website
        says it seeks anyone who is \u201ca data geek, an entrepreneur, a developer,
        a designer, a maker.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<p><div style=\"margin:10px auto

        White House video calls on tech experts to apply for the Presidential Innovation
        Fellows program.</em></div></p><br />\n<br />\n\u201cIf you\u2019re using
        the skills of the 21st century to make things happen, there are endless opportunities,\u201d
        the video says. \u201cBut there\u2019s one key opportunity to put your talents
        to use that you may not have thought of -- the federal government. Government
        matters. It matters a lot. And it needs people like you.\u201d <br />\n<br
        />\nAbout one-third of fellows stay to work full-time in government. More
        than a dozen now work for 18F. One former fellow, Marina Martin, is now chief
        technology officer for the Department of Veterans Affairs, which badly needs
        the help. The VA has about one IT staffer for every 40 employees -- one of
        the lowest ratios in the federal government, <a href=\"http://fcw.com/articles/2013/05/01/veterans-affairs-trouble.aspx\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a 2012 report by the consulting firm Deloitte.</a><br
        />\n<br />\nYet even new government ventures like 18F can face roadblocks.
        Most tech startups can test their products publicly at any time, but 18F must
        undergo an extensive cybersecurity test before introducing a website to ensure
        it can\u2019t be hacked. That process can take several weeks or more.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cThere are limitations in how we can engage the public,\u201d Hartley
        said. <br />\n<br />\nThe government\u2019s recruiting troubles are compounded
        by its slow hiring process. While tech firms can hire new engineers in about
        a week, government agencies take more than 100 days on average to hire IT
        specialists, according to Steven VanRoekel, the chief information officer
        for the White House Office of Management and Budget. <br />\n<br />\nThe Obama
        administration is now looking to waive some hiring rules -- like posting jobs
        publicly for weeks, evaluating multiple candidates, or doing lengthy background
        checks -- to compete with Silicon Valley, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cThere
        are things in place because of process and history that don\u2019t give us
        a leg up in that fight for the best talent,\u201d VanRoekel said.<br />\n<br
        />\nEmployees at 18F are also trying to speed up the process. They have shortened
        the time it takes to hire workers from nine months to two months, mostly by
        cutting the amount of people handling interviews, paperwork and other red
        tape.  And they\u2019ve introduced modern ways of building technology, like
        testing projects along the way instead of waiting until they are done months
        later, a method used by government contractors that yielded disastrous results
        with HealthCare.gov.<br />\n<br />\n18F does not operate under different rules
        than the rest of the federal government. Instead, it is trying to bring ideas
        from the startup world and make them work within the myriad rules of the government
        bureaucracy, according to 18F co-founder Greg Godbout. \"We''re not afraid
        of taking risks,\" he said, \"but we don''t have the risk tolerance of Silicon
        Valley.\"<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px; margin-top:30px;\"><img

        18F to help the federal government build technology. (Photo: Gerry Smith/Huffington
        Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nBy appearances alone, 18F bears little
        resemblance to a typical Silicon Valley startup. Its office is located past
        a metal detector inside a hulking federal building that is home to the General
        Services Administration. While many startups have founders in their 20s, 18F
        was started by three former Presidential Innovations Fellows in their late
        30s and early 40s.<br />\n<br />\nHartley, 38, had worked previously for a
        company that builds websites and other online tools for federal, state and
        local governments. She started 18F with Aaron Snow, 43, a former lawyer and
        programmer who once co-founded a personalized shopping app, and Godbout, 41,
        an IT expert who owns the Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse. They say they started
        18F to take the idea of the fellowship program and make it permanent. <br
        />\n<br />\nThe three co-founders talk like data geeks, often referring to
        their open-source code and A.P.I., or application programming interface. They
        are hoping to grow 18F to more than 50 employees by the end of July largely
        by recruiting from Washington\u2019s community of civic-minded programmers,
        including Code For America, a nonprofit that builds websites for city governments.
        <br />\n<br />\n\u201cThese are people who want to do good work for the government,\u201d
        Hartley said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re giving them a home.\u201d<br />\n<br
        />\nLast month, 18F introduced one of its first projects: <a href=\"http://NotAlone.gov\"
        target=\"_hplink\">NotAlone.gov</a>, a government website with resources on
        handling sexual assault on college campuses. It is unclear whether 18F will
        be a model for the rest of the federal government, but some observers say
        it offers a glimmer of hope.<br />\n<br />\n\"It''s essentially, I would say
        at this point, unproven,\u201d Greg Gershman, a software engineer and former
        Presidential Innovation Fellow, said of the venture. \u201cBut I think it
        shows a lot of promise. They''re trying to hire developers, hire designers,
        the kind of people who should''ve been working on things like HealthCare.gov
        from the beginning.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhen HealthCare.gov crashed last
        October, the White House tapped tech experts from Obama\u2019s 2012 presidential
        campaign to salvage the website. Some former campaign techies are <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/healthcare-gov-revamp\"
        target=\"_hplink\">now working on an overhaul of the health care portal</a>
        that will include methods commonly used by startups, like hosting parts of

        obvious reason why the country\u2019s top tech talent avoids Washington is
        money. While the average salaries for engineers in the private sector and
        government are about the same -- around $85,000 a year, <a href=\"http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/Dice_TechSalarySurvey_2013.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to a survey by Dice, a technology-recruitment
        service</a> -- tech firms typically offer employees stock options in addition
        to their salaries, creating a potential windfall if the company succeeds.
        Government employees, on the other hand, have recently been subject to <a
        href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2013/10/16/furloughed-employees-typically-would-return-on-day-after-shutdown-ends/\"
        target=\"_hplink\">furloughs and pay freezes.</a><br />\n<br />\nBut dreams
        of dot-com riches only partly explain why tech experts don\u2019t pursue government
        work. If Washington wants to attract more computer wizards, it may also need
        to dramatically change its culture.<br />\n<br />\nThe culture differences
        between Silicon Valley and Washington were evident last October during the
        troubled rollout of HealthCare.gov. At the time, a team of tech experts handpicked
        by The White House, including veterans from Google, traveled to the offices
        of CGI Federal, an IT contractor in Northern Virginia, to fix the broken website.
        <br />\n<br />\nWhen they arrived on a Saturday, they were stunned by what
        they found. The parking lot was virtually empty. So were the chairs inside
        the building that should have been filled by programmers and managers scrambling
        to save the online exchange.<br />\n<br />\nThe exhausted contractor employees
        who built most of the crippled website had taken the weekend off, according
        to members of the rescue team who said they could not speak on the record
        because of nondisclosure agreements they had signed.<br />\n<br />\nAt most
        tech companies, failing to show up for work on a weekend during a crisis would
        be unheard of, said Mike Abbott, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and
        former vice president of engineering at Twitter who helped fix the health
        care website.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cOut here, if something is broken, you do
        whatever it takes to fix it -- you stay up all night or work weekends,\u201d
        Abbott said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense that same level of ownership and urgency
        to solve the issue when I arrived.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSuch bewilderment
        among tech experts is common in Washington, where \u201cthe culture is radically
        different\u201d than in Silicon Valley, according to Anne Marie Slaughter,
        a former director of policy planning at the State Department.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt\u2019s
        what I would call the difference between the culture of the \u2018presumptive
        no\u2019 and the \u2018presumptive yes,\u2019\u201d Slaughter said at a recent
        forum. \u201cThe \u2018presumptive yes\u2019 is the culture of Silicon Valley,
        it\u2019s the culture of technology. It\u2019s \u2018that\u2019s a cool idea,
        let\u2019s see whether that would work ... The \u2018presumptive yes\u2019
        is not the culture of Washington.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"width:100%;margin-bottom:30px;

        federal government after an IT project he worked on was never introduced.
        (Photo: Damon Scheleur/Huffington Post)</em></div></div><br />\n<br />\nChris
        Frommann, 27, has seen first-hand how this culture clash impacts government
        tech projects. Four years ago, Frommann turned down a job at Microsoft to
        join a team of engineers in Washington working for the Social Security Administration.<br
        />\n<br />\nThe atmosphere was unlike anything he\u2019d experienced before.
        Employees were required to leave by 6 p.m. -- even if they needed to stay
        late to finish a project -- because there wasn\u2019t money to pay for overtime.
        By contrast, employees at startups routinely work long hours, especially leading
        up to a new product launch.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment programmers were also
        still writing code in COBOL -- an obsolete computer language developed in
        the 1950s and still used by some government agencies, Frommann said.<br />\n<br
        />\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if the auto industry insisted on using Henry Ford technology
        despite the innovation over the last 70 years,\u201d he said.<br />\n<br />\nAt
        the time, Frommann and other engineers were building software that would allow
        people to apply for government benefits online and immediately learn if they
        were eligible. Employees would no longer need to process applications by hand.
        The project would have saved the administration as much as $1 billion a year
        on technology, IT personnel and case workers, he said.<br />\n<br />\nBut
        after several months of work, Frommann''s boss was suddenly fired and the
        team was broken up, a casualty of \u201cinternal politics,\u201d Frommann
        said. The project wasn''t introduced. Frustrated his work never came to fruition,
        Frommann quit.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cIt definitely disappointed me and I became
        less naive,\u201d said Frommann, who now works for a media analytics startup
        with other techies from the 2012 Obama campaign. \u201cI still plan to work
        in government, and I still want to be a public servant, but I\u2019ll be a
        lot more cautious about the team and the project because I\u2019ve already
        been burned.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nHis disappointment with such projects is
        not unusual. Only 6 percent of large government IT projects over the past
        decade were deemed successful -- the rest were delayed, over budget, didn\u2019t
        meet expectations, or failed completely, <a href=\"http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/BigBangBoom.pdf\"
        target=\"_hplink\">according to research by the Standish Group, a consulting
        firm.</a><br />\n<br />\nThat dismal record is why the founders of 18F say
        they chose to work for the government: They wanted silence the critics.<br
        />\n<br />\n\u201cThere are many people who think government can\u2019t get
        technology right,\u201d Snow said. \u201cI love coming to work every day and
        proving them wrong.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n</div><br />\n<br />\n<style type=\"text/css\">.articleBody
